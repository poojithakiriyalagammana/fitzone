    <h3>Our Story</h3>
    <p>FitZone Fitness Center was established in 2015 with a mission to provide a state-of-the-art fitness facility to the Kurunegala community. Our founder, John Doe, a fitness enthusiast and certified personal trainer, realized the need for a comprehensive fitness center that caters to people of all fitness levels and ages.</p>
    <p>Starting with just a small studio and a handful of equipment, FitZone has grown into a full-fledged fitness center with modern facilities, expert trainers, and a wide range of fitness programs.</p>
